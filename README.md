<h1> Overview</h1>
In this repository, the project for tthe Digital Signal and Image Management exam is reported. In particular, three main tasks are addressed:
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Speaker recognition:</b> several featuters are extracted by wav files of 5s of duration, cointaining variable sentences and background noise. 
Different models are trained in order to recognize three different speakers;</li>
<li><b>Face recognition:</b> faces are detected and extrapolated from photos containing different subjects in different places, poses and illumination conditions. Both fine tuning and transfer learning from different pre-trained models are use in order to recognize three different faces;</li><p></p>
<li><b>Retrieval:</b> Different models are used in order to find the most similar faces in a given dataset with respect to three different people. A new method of quality check of the suggested images is provided (avoiding the pixelation phenomenon); </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
All the notebooks are commented for further details and optimized to be ran on Colab.
